# Fish-Shell-Config
You will need to install Fish and fuzzy finder and vim or neovim

### To install Fish
Follow the download instructions for your OS to install the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)

### Install fzf
Follow the installation instructions for your OS to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation)

### Install Vim
Follow the installation instructions for your OS to install [vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php)

### Install Neovim
Follow the installation instructions for your OS to install [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)


Files you will want to change to match the correct path:
- fzf_key_binding.fish

This file will contain a symlink to your fzf config if you are on Linux. This has not been tested on MacOS or Windows yet so I can't comment on whether it works for either of those OS's
